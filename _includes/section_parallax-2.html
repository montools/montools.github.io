        <p class="subtitle is-4 has-text-grey-lighter">
          <p>
            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5">1. Introduction</h5>
            Welcome to Montools Find & Replace for WorkDocs ("the App").
            This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle user data when you use the App
            within monday.com.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5"> 2. Data Collection & Usage</h5>
            The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or document data
            outside of monday.com. All search and replace actions occur within the
            monday.com environment without external data processing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5">3. Permissions & Access</h5>
            To function correctly, the App requires access to monday.com WorkDocs.
            This access is used solely for executing search and replace operations as initiated by the user.
            The App does not retain, analyze, or share document data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5">4. Data Security</h5>
            We follow best practices to ensure that user data remains secure.
            The App operates entirely within monday.com's infrastructure and does not introduce
            additional data storage, logging, or external processing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5">5. Third-Party Integrations</h5>
            The App does not integrate with external third-party services and does not transmit
            any user data outside of monday.com.

            <h5 class="title is-5 mt-5">6. User Rights & Control</h5>
            As the App does not store any personal or document data, users do not need to request
            data deletion or modification. All content remains under the control of the user
            within their monday.com account.
          </p>
